            <p>I was born in chicago, Illinois. From there I moved to Washington, Colorado, Las vegas, California, and now here Utah. <br>
            We moved around alot as a kid for my dads work, "Go where the money is kinda thing." Growing up I played baseball and football.<br>
            I continued to play threw highschool and thought id be playing in college at this point, but I got married instead. I got married<br>
            almost four months ago, we were married in the Salt Lake Temple. Below is a picture of my beautiful wife Allie and myself.</p>
