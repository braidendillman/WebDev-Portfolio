    <p>I have been in constuction for almost five years. I started when I was fourteen working for my grandpa. Over the years I learned<br>
    multiple different trades. Working in such a hard industy has taught me alot about hard work, people, and doing a quality job. Although<br>
I am on my way out of the trades i'm glad I spent the time in them that I have. Below is a list of things I might do on a day to day basis<br>
at work.
<li>Tile work</li>
<li>Framing
</li>
<li>Finish Carpentry</li><br>
Below are some pictures of work that I do. Some of these pictures are from million dollar houses that I have worked on! <br>
